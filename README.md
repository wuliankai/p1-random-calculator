This is my first project, the random calculator.

On every instance of this game (in the randomCalculator, randCalcV2, randCalcV3 folder) the black box represents the input the player is expected to match.
The white box represents user input display.
The player input box is represented by the blue buttons. All have been coded to randomly populate on page refresh, and when the correct input has been given.

This has been a fun project for me in terms of game balancing, allowing me to manipualte and play with JS code. However, it must be said that it is very simple.
I hope to make up for it in project 2.

Oh, and also if you run randCalcV2.html, bring up the console and press the C button for the expected input.
